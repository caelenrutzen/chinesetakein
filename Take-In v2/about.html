				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>We teach people of all ages to cook fancy (gourmet) meals alongside standard kitchen safety and ingredient shopping techniques.
				We feel that everyone should know how to cook and enjoy a delicious meal from the comfort of their own home. 
				There is no reason for someone to go out and waste tons of money on food just because they feel they cannot cook it themselves! Anything is possible, and we are here to prove it to you!
				When you leave this course, you will have an extensive knowledge of basic cooking techniques, including correct temperatures, how to recognize when something is cooked to perfection, and how to detect congruent flavor palettes.
				When you sign up for Chinese Take-In, you will be put into a class of up to 40 different students. Each week, we host two classes of people, and each class meets twice. 
				Classes are held on Mondays/Wednesdays and Tuesdays/Thursdays.
				Our mission is to spread cooking knowledge throughout the world so that those birds who are leaving the nest for the first time can keep themselves fed in a delicious way!</p>

				<h2>Our Staff</h2>
				<p>Our amazing staff here at Chinese Take-In are highly trained and specialized asian chefs. We feel this is important because all of our recipes that we offer contain varieties of different asian flavors from mixed asian cultures. 
				Having expert chefs who specialize in asian cuisine allows our students to learn which flavors clash and which do not, and ultimately teaches them how to create a perfect meal. Furthermore, our staff are experts in kitchen-safety, and are more than happy to spread the love of the kitchen to all those who want it!</p>
