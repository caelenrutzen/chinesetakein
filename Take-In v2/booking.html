			<h2>Class Pricing</h2>
				<p>When you pay the $40, you pay for both classes. We like to keep the entrance price cheap for our students, so that they will have funds left over for grocery shopping for ingredients.
				 This price applies to two students because we like our students to work with a partner. This helps build a bond between two chefs, and allows our students to learn how working in a team environment can help a kitchen run efficiently.</p>
			<h2>Class Booking</h2>
				<p>In order to sign up for a class, you need to check the class schedule. If the Monday/Wednesday class is filled up for the week, you can either sign up for the Tuesday/Thursday class (assuming it is also not filled up), or sign up for the Monday/Wednesday class for the following week.
				 We recommend that you sign up for the classes a few weeks ahead of time, so that you and your partner can schedule a few hours free for each class!</p>
